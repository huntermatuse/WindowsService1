I have 'improved' the code to append to the log file instead of writing over it. 

```C#
private void WriteToFile(string Message)
{
    string path = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory + "\\Logs";
    if (!Directory.Exists(path))
    {
        Directory.CreateDirectory(path);
    }

    string filepath = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory + "\\Logs\\ServiceLog_" + DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString().Replace('/', '_') + ".txt";

    using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(filepath, true))
    {
        sw.WriteLine(Message);
    }
}
```
Functional Spec as read by LLAMA3
**1. Overview:**

The Windows Service Logging System is designed to periodically log events to a file. This system writes a log file containing the service's start time, stop time, and periodic execution timestamps. The system is designed to handle file writing efficiently and maintain a consistent log format.

**2. Functional Requirements:**

- **2.1. Service Start Logging:**
  - When the service starts, it should log a message indicating the start time in the log file.
  - The log entry format should include the message: "Service has started at `<start time>`," where `<start time>` is the precise timestamp of the start event.

- **2.2. Periodic Logging:**
  - The service should log a message at regular intervals using a timer, indicating the periodic execution timestamp.
  - The timer interval should be configurable via a variable, with a default interval of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).
  - Each periodic log entry should follow the format: "Service has run at `<timestamp>`," where `<timestamp>` is the precise timestamp of the periodic event.

- **2.3. Service Stop Logging:**
  - When the service stops, it should log a message indicating the stop time in the log file.
  - The log entry format should include the message: "Service was stopped at `<stop time>`," where `<stop time>` is the precise timestamp of the stop event.

**3. Non-Functional Requirements:**

- **3.1. File Management:**
  - The service should ensure that all log files are written to a `Logs` folder under the serviceâ€™s base directory.
  - The log file should be named in the format `ServiceLog_<date>.txt`, where `<date>` represents the current date in the format `MM_DD_YYYY`.
  - Log files should be created or appended based on the current date. All logs from a single day are written into the same file.

- **3.2. Error Handling:**
  - If the `Logs` folder does not exist, the service should create it automatically.
  - If the system encounters an error writing to a file, an exception should be raised with a descriptive error message.

**4. Implementation Details:**

- **4.1. Service Initialization:**
  - The `OnStart` method should initialize the timer and set up its interval and event handler.
  - The method should enable the timer to start periodic logging.

- **4.2. Timer Event Handler:**
  - The timer event handler (`OnElapsedTime`) should call the `WriteToFile` method to log periodic events.

- **4.3. Logging Method:**
  - The `WriteToFile` method should accept a string message and append it to the appropriate log file.

- **4.4. Timer Configuration:**
  - The timer should be an instance of the `System.Timers.Timer` class and configured for the desired interval.

- **4.5. Directory Management:**
  - The `WriteToFile` method should verify the existence of the `Logs` folder before writing a file, and create the folder if missing.

**5. Testing Requirements:**

- **5.1. Start Logging Test:**
  - Verify that starting the service correctly logs the start event.

- **5.2. Periodic Logging Test:**
  - Verify that the service logs periodic events at the specified interval.

- **5.3. Stop Logging Test:**
  - Verify that stopping the service logs the stop event.

- **5.4. File Management Tests:**
  - Verify that the `Logs` folder is created if it does not exist.
  - Verify that log files are named according to the current date.
  - Ensure that multiple log entries for the same day are appended to the same file.

**6. Future Enhancements:**

- **6.1. Log Rotation:**
  - Add a mechanism to archive or delete old log files after a configurable retention period.

- **6.2. Log Level Customization:**
  - Implement different log levels (e.g., Info, Warning, Error) and allow dynamic filtering of log messages.
